Quickstart
==========

Let's carve out a space in the local file system and poke around.

>>> from upathlib import LocalUpath
>>> p = LocalUpath('/tmp/abc')

This creates a :class:`~upathlib.LocalUpath` object ``p`` that points to the location
``'/tmp/abc'``. This may be an existing file, or directory, or may be nonexistent.
We know this is a temporary location; to be sure we have a clear playground, let's
wipe out anything and everything:

>>> p.rmrf()
0

Think ``rm -rf /tmp/abc``. It does just that. The returned `0` means zero files were deleted.

Now let's create a file and write something to it:

>>> (p / 'x.txt').write_text('first')

This creates file ``/tmp/abc/x.txt`` with the content ``'first'``. Note the directory ``'/tmp/abc'``
did not exist before the call. We did not need to "create the parent directory".
In fact, ``upathlib`` does not provide a way to do that.
In ``upathlib``, "directory" is a "virtual" thing that is embodied by a group of files.
For example, if there exist

::

    /tmp/abc/x.txt
    /tmp/abc/d/y.data

we say there is directories ``'/tmp/abc'`` and ``'/tmp/abc/d'``, but we
don't create these "directories" by themselves. These directories come into being
if there exist such files.

Let's actually create these files:

>>> (p / 'x.txt').write_text('second', overwrite=True)
>>> (p / 'd' / 'y.data').write_bytes(b'0101')

Now let's look into this directory:

>>> p.is_dir()
True
>>> (p / 'd').is_dir()
True
>>> (p / 'x.txt').is_dir()
False
>>> (p / 'x.txt').is_file()
True

We can navigate in the directory. For example,

>>> for v in sorted(p.iterdir()):  # the sort merely makes the result stable
...     print(v)
/tmp/abc/d
/tmp/abc/x.txt

This is only the first level, or "direct children". We can also use "recursive iterdir"
to get all files under the directory, descending into subdirectories recursively:

>>> for v in sorted(p.riterdir()):  # the sort merely makes the result stable
...     print(v)
/tmp/abc/d/y.data
/tmp/abc/x.txt

This time only *files* are listed. Subdirectories do not show up because,
after all, they are *not real* in ``upathlib`` concept.

We can as easily read a file, like

>>> (p / 'x.txt').read_text()
'second'

Several common file formats are provided out of the box, including
text, bytes, json, and pickle, as well as compressed versions by 
`zlib <https://www.zlib.net/>`_ and 
`Zstandard <http://facebook.github.io/zstd/>`_.

Let's do some JSON:

>>> pp = p / 'e/f/g/data.json'
>>> pp.write_json({'name': 'John', 'age': 38})

We know the JSON file is also a text file, so we can treat it as such:

>>> pp.read_text()
'{"name": "John", "age": 38}'

But usually we prefer to get back the Python object directly:

>>> v = pp.read_json()
>>> v
{'name': 'John', 'age': 38}
>>> type(v)
<class 'dict'>

We can go "down" the directory tree using ``/``.
Conversely, we can go "up" using :meth:`~upathlib.Upath.parent`:

>>> pp.path
PosixPath('/tmp/abc/e/f/g/data.json')
>>> pp.parent
LocalUpath('/tmp/abc/e/f/g')
>>> pp.parent.parent
LocalUpath('/tmp/abc/e/f')
>>> pp.parent.parent.is_dir()
True
>>> pp.parent.parent.is_file()
False

or the terminal-lovers' ``..``:

>>> pp
LocalUpath('/tmp/abc/e/f/g/data.json')
>>> pp / '..'
LocalUpath('/tmp/abc/e/f/g')
>>> pp / '..' / '..'
LocalUpath('/tmp/abc/e/f')

Under the hood, ``/`` delegates to a call to :meth:`~upathlib.Upath.joinpath`:

>>> pp.joinpath('../../o/p/q')
LocalUpath('/tmp/abc/e/f/o/p/q')

Let's see again what we have:

>>> sorted(p.riterdir())
[LocalUpath('/tmp/abc/d/y.data'), LocalUpath('/tmp/abc/e/f/g/data.json'), LocalUpath('/tmp/abc/x.txt')]

and to get rid of them all:

>>> p.rmrf()
3

A nice thing about ``upathlib`` is the "unified" nature across local and cloud storages.
Suppose we have set up the environment to use Google Cloud Storage, then we could have started this excercise with


>>> from upathlib import GcsBlobUpath
>>> p = GcsBlobUpath('gs://my-bucket/tmp/abc')

Everything after this would work unchanged. (The printouts would be different at some places, 
e.g. :class:`LocalUpath` would be replaced by :class:`GcsBlobUpath`.)

Using upathlib to implement a "multiplexer"
===========================================

:class:`~upathlib.multiplexer.Multiplexer` is a utility for distributing data elements to multiple concurrent or distributed workers.
Its implementation relies on the "locking" capability of :class:`~upathlib.Upath`.

Suppose we perform some brute-force search on a cluster of machines;
there are 1000 grids, and the algorithm takes on one grid at a time.
Now, the grid is a "hyper-parameter" or "control parameter" that takes 1000 possible values.
We want to distribute these 1000 values to the workers.
This is the kind of use cases targeted by ``Multiplexer``.

Let's show its usage using local data and multiprocessing.
(For real work, we would use cloud storage and a cluster of machines.)
First, create a ``Multiplexer`` to hold the values to be distributed:

>>> from upathlib import LocalUpath
>>> from upathlib.multiplexer import Multiplexer
>>> p = LocalUpath('/tmp/abc/mux')
>>> p.rmrf()
0
>>> hyper = Multiplexer.new(range(20), p)
>>> len(hyper)
20

Next, design an interesting worker function:

>>> import multiprocessing, random, time
>>>
>>> def worker(mux_id):
...     for x in Multiplexer(mux_id):
...         time.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 0.2))  # doing a lot of things
...         print(x, 'done in', multiprocessing.current_process().name)

Back in the main process,

>>> mux_id = hyper.create_read_session()
>>> tasks = [multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(mux_id,)) for _ in range(5)]
>>> for t in tasks:
...     t.start()
>>>
2 done in Process-13
0 done in Process-11
1 done in Process-12
4 done in Process-15
3 done in Process-14
6 done in Process-11
7 done in Process-12
8 done in Process-15
5 done in Process-13
9 done in Process-14
12 done in Process-15
13 done in Process-13
11 done in Process-12
10 done in Process-11
14 done in Process-14
15 done in Process-15
18 done in Process-11
16 done in Process-13
17 done in Process-12
19 done in Process-14
>>>
>>> for t in tasks:
...     t.join()
>>> hyper.done(mux_id)
True
>>> hyper.destroy()
>>>
