"""
The package *upathlib*
defines a unified API for cloud blob store (aka "object store") as well as local file systems.

Attention is focused on identifying the *most essential* functionalities
while working with a blob store for data processing.
Functionalities in a traditional local file system that are secondary in these tasks---such
as symbolic links, fine-grained permissions, and various access modes---are ignored.

End user should look to the class :class:`~upathlib.Upath` for documentation of the API.
Local file system is implemented by :class:`LocalUpath`, which subclasses Upath.
Client for Google Cloud Storage (i.e. blob store on GCP) is implemented by another Upath subclass,
namely :class:`~upathlib.GcsBlobUpath`.

One use case is the package `biglist <https://biglist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__,
where the class `Biglist <https://biglist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#biglist.Biglist>`__ takes a Upath object to indicate its location of storage.
It does not care whether the storage is local or in a cloud blob store---it
simply uses the common API to operate the storage.
