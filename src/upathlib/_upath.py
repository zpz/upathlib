:class:`Upath` is an abstract base class that defines the APIs and some of the implementation.
Subclasses tailor to particular storage systems.
Currently there are two production-ready subclasses; they implement ``Upath``
for local file systems and Google Cloud Storage, respectively.

The APIs follow the style of the standard library
`pathlib <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html>`_ where appropriate.

        Create a ``Upath`` instance. Because ``Upath`` is an abstract class,
        this is always called on a subclass to instantiate a path on the specific
        storage system.

        Subclasses for cloud blob stores may need to add additional parameters
        representing, e.g., container/bucket name, etc.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *pathsegments
            Analogous to the input to `pathlib.Path <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path>`_.
            The first segment may or may not start with ``'/'``.
            The path constructed with ``*pathsegments`` is always "absolute" under a known "root".

            For a local POSIX file system, the root is the usual ``'/'``.

            For a local Windows file system, the root is resolved to a particular "drive".

            For Azure blob store, the root is that in a "container".

            For AWS and GCP blob stores, the root is that in a "bucket".

            If missing, the path constructed is the "root". However,
            the subclass :class:`LocalUpath` plugs in the current working directory
            for a missing ``*pathsegments``.

            .. note:: If one segment starts with ``'/'``, it will reset to the "root"
                and discard all the segments that have come before it. For example,
                ``Upath('work', 'projects', '/', 'projects')``
                is the same as ``Upath('/', 'projects)``.

            .. note:: The first element of ``*pathsegments`` may start with some platform-specific
                strings. For example, ``'/'`` on Linux, ``'c://'`` on Windows, ``'gs://'`` on
                Google Cloud Storage. Please see subclasses for specifics.

        reasonably long time. To wait "forever", just pass in a large number.

        ``timeout=0`` is a valid input, meaning making exactly one attempt to acquire a lock.

        Once a lock is acquired, it will not expire until this contexmanager exits.
        In other words, this is timeout for the "lock acquisition", not for the
        lock itself. Actual waiting time could be slightly longer or shorter.

        This is a "mandatory lock", as opposed to an "advisory lock".
        The intended use case is for this lock to be used
        for implementing a (cooperative) "code lock".

        As this abstract method is to be used as a context manager,
        a subclass should use ``yield`` in its implementation.
        The ``yield`` statement is not required to yield anything,
        that is, it may be simply

        ::

            yield

        rather than, say,

        ::

            yield self

        One way to achive cooperative locking on a file via this

            f = Upath('abc.txt')
            with f.with_suffix('.txt.lock').lock():
                ...
                # Now write to `f` with exclusive access,
                # because any other (cooperative) code block
                # will not be able to get hold of `abc.txt.lock`
                # in order to write to `f` using this same code block
                # (or in another block that deliberately uses the same file lock).
                # Reading can be made exclusive by this same lock mechanism.

        .. note:: This method should always be called on an "auxiliary file" (like in the example above),
          whose sole purpose is to implement the lock; the file being locked should not be used for any other purpose.

        .. note:: It's up to a specific subclass to decide whether it should delete the lock file
          just before exiting the context manager.

        Some storage engines may not provide the capability to implement
        this lock.
