## [0.6.9] - 2023-01-07

### Removed

- Parameters `project_id` and `credentials` to `GcsBlobUpath.__init__`.
- Classmethods `register_read_write_byte_format`, `register_read_write_text_format` of `Upath`.
- Parameter `thread_pool_executors` to `Upath.__init__`.
- Methods `rename_dir` and `rename_file` in `Upath` (both remain in `LocalUpath`).
- Classes `ZJsonSerializer`, `ZstdJsonSerializer`.
- Back-compat module `upathlib.gcp`.
- Methods `export_dir`, `export_file`, `import_dir`, `import_file`. (Concentrate on the `copy_*` methods.)
- Method `with_path` renamed to `_with_path` and has become an intermediate implementation helper based on the new property `root`.

- `GcsBlobUpath.get_blob` is removed.

### Deprecated

- `LocalUpath.localpath`. (Use `LocalUpath.path` instead.)

### Changed

- `LocalUpath.path` overrides the super version to return `pathlib.Path`.
- The tests module `upathlib.tests` was renamed `_tests`.
- Simplified comparison and ordering special methods.

### Added or enhanced

- Enhancements to documentation, including Sphinx documentation generation and hosting on readthedocs.
- New method `as_uri`. Comparison, ordering, and hash special methods are changed to use the output of `as_uri`.
- `LocalUpath` now implements the `os.PathLike` protocol.
- Methods `read_text`, `write_text`, `read_json`, `write_json` get parameters `encoding` and `errors`.
- New property `root`.
- Initial support for Windows by `LocalUpath`. `test_local.py` passed on Windows, but there could be corner cases that will fail on Windows.


## [0.6.8] - 2022-11-16

- New helper function `resolve_path`.
- Many directory operations dropped the `desc` parameter but gained the `quiet` parameter, defaulting to `False`. But, `rmdir` and `rmrf` default to `quiet=True`.
- `GcpBlobUpath` is also exposed in `__init__.py`.
- Parameters `project_id` and `credentials` of `GcpBlobUpath` are deprecated. This info is moved to a classmethod. Similar changes to `AzureBlobUpath`.
- Renamed `upathlib.gcp` to `upathlib.gcs`, and `GcpBlobUpath` to `GcsBlobUpath`.


## [0.6.7] - 2022-11-03

- Handle "empty folders" in GCP.
- Use Google's standard way (via `google.auth.default`) to get GCP credentials if needed.
- Allow disabling progress bar in most cases by setting `desc` to `False`.
- Thread-pool management; `_run_in_executor` became an instance method (as opposed to classmethod).


## [0.6.6] - 2022-10-07

- Improvement to robustness in large directory upload to Gcp.
- Improved progress report when downloading/uploading a directory.
- Fine-tuned methods `import_file` and `export_file`.
- Bug fix in `GcpBlotUpath.with_path`. The bug causes scalability (when operating on upwards of 56000 files) and speed issues in `upload_dir`, because every blob will create its own `Client`.
- Removed `LockAcquisitionTimeoutError`. Added `LockAcquireError`, `LockReleaseError`.
- `GcpBlobUpath.lock` reduces default wait time to improve responsiveness.


## [0.6.5] - 2022-07-30

- Make GCP info to `GcpBlobUpath` optional.
- Remove home-made retrying utility `Backoff`. Use `opnieumw`.
- Bug fix related to concurrent downloading involving large files.


## [0.6.4] - 2022-07-10

- GCP download of large blobs uses threading concurrency.
- API change: `write_bytes` and `write_text` return `None`.
- Improvements to handling of concurrency.
- Increased default concurrency level from 4 to 16.
- Simplified retry logic. For example, GCP's `download_to_file` has its own
  handling of retry; now we rely on `download_to_file` to finish the task
  and do not retry on it.
- Simplified parameters and behavior around 'overwrite'.
- Improvements to serializers:
  - Serializers allow extra arguments in their `serialize` and `deserialize` methods.
  - Added dependency `zstandard` to provide compression.
  - New serializers `ZJsonSerializer`, `ZstdJsonSerializer`, `ZstdPickleSerializer`, `ZstdOrjsonSerializer`.


## [0.6.3] - 2022-03-06

- Use `overrides` to enforce sanity in class inheritance.
- Add tests on Azure and GCP using mocks.
- Add more retry logic to GCP.
- Refactor and simplify test/build process.

- Support extra dependencies via `options.extras_require` in `setup.cfg`.


## [0.5.1] - 2021-07-22

- Reworked `AzureBlobUpath.lock` and `AzureBlobUpath.a_lock`.


## [0.5.0] - 2021-07-19

- `remove_file` loses argument `missing_ok`. Return 0 if file is not found.
- `GcpBlobUpath` copy, download, upload, rename.
- `BlobUpath` gets more methods for download and upload, which are thin wrappers
  around export and import methods.


## [0.4.9] - 2021-07-18

- Another round of API fine tuning. There are some improvements to naming,
  consistency, and simplicity.
- `AzureBlobUpath` has custom blob copying, uploading, downloading.
- Improvements to tests.


## [0.4.5] - 2021-07-10

- Remove `AzureBlobUpath` and `GcpBlobUpath` from package `__init__.py`,
  making their dependencies optional in a future release.
