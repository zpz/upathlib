# upathlib: universal Pathlib

This package defines some APIs that are most relevant to a client of a cloud blob store (or object store). These APIs are intentionally similar to the corresponding APIs of the standard [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) where appropriate.

Local filesystem is treated as one particular case.
