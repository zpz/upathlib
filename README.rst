upathlib
========

The package ``upathlib``
defines a unified API for cloud blob store (aka "object store") as well as local file systems.

After release 0.9.8, this package was merged into the package 
[``cloudly``](https://github.com/zpz/cloudly). The release 0.9.9 is a simple proxy
pointing to relevant parts of ``cloudly`` for backward compatibility purposes.
The user is encouraged to migrate to using ``cloudly`` directly.
